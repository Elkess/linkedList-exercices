# linkedList-exercices

1. Basic Operations
1.1 Create a Singly Linked List
Implement a Node structure with data and next.
Implement a LinkedList class that initializes an empty list.
1.2 Insertions
Insert at the beginning
Insert at the end
Insert at a specific position
Insert after a given node
1.3 Deletions
Delete from the beginning
Delete from the end
Delete from a specific position
Delete a node by value
1.4 Searching
Search for an element (return true if found, otherwise false).
1.5 Display (Traversal)
Print all elements in the linked list.
2. Intermediate Operations
2.1 Length of a Linked List
Count the number of nodes iteratively and recursively.
2.2 Reverse a Linked List
Iteratively reverse the linked list.
Recursively reverse the linked list.
2.3 Find the Middle Element
Use slow and fast pointers to find the middle node.
2.4 Detect a Loop (Cycle) in the Linked List
Use Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm (slow and fast pointers).
2.5 Remove Duplicates
Remove duplicates from a sorted linked list.
Remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
2.6 Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists
Given two sorted linked lists, merge them into a single sorted list.
2.7 Find the nth Node from the End
Use two-pointer technique to find the nth node from the end in one pass.
3. Advanced Operations
3.1 Check if the Linked List is a Palindrome
Use a stack or reverse half of the list to check.
3.2 Detect and Remove a Loop in the Linked List
Use slow and fast pointers to detect a loop.
Remove the loop if found.
3.3 Rotate a Linked List
Given a number k, rotate the list to the right by k positions.
3.4 Intersection of Two Linked Lists
Find the node where two linked lists merge.
3.5 Sorting a Linked List
Sort the linked list using Merge Sort.
3.6 Convert a Linked List to a Binary Search Tree (BST)
Convert a sorted linked list into a balanced BST.
